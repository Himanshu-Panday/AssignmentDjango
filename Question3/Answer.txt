By default, Django signals do not necessarily run in the same database transaction as the caller. The execution of signals depends on when they are triggered:

1.Pre-save (pre_save) and Post-save (post_save) Signals

 - pre_save runs before the database transaction is committed.
 - post_save runs after the model instance is saved but before the transaction is committed.

2.Post-commit (on_commit) Signals

 - Signals inside on_commit execute only after the transaction is successfully committed.



Explanation:

1.The User.objects.create() triggers the post_save signal.
2.The signal runs before the transaction is committed.
3.Even though the transaction is rolled back, the signal executes and prints that the user exists in the database at the time of execution.
4.This proves that Django signals do not automatically wait for the transaction to be committed.
