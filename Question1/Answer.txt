Django signals are executed synchronously by default. This means that when a signal is triggered, the connected receiver functions execute immediately in the same thread as the signal sender.


Explanation:

1.The message "User save method completed." appears after the signal processing is done.
2.This proves that the signal execution is 'blocking' (i.e., synchronous).
3.If signals were asynchronous by default, "User save method completed." would appear immediately after "Saving user...", without waiting for the signal to complete.
